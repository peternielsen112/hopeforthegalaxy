# Currently available:

- Choosing ships from the command line. You may choose 'awing', 'falcon', or 'xwing'. In the event that no choice is made or something invalid is given, the x-wing acts as default.
- Special abilities and universal fire. Pressing space shoots a laser blast at incoming tie fighters. Pressing the down key fires a quad-laser for the Millennium Falcon, an ion blast for the a-wing, and a proton torpedo for the x-wing.
- A 'start' screen. Press the down arrow on the start screen to begin the game.


### Likely developments in the future:
The adding of allies, the death star, and Yavin. Potentially other planets or missions.
A wait time between beginning and game start


# IMPORTANT:
This game will likely be redesigned into a JavaScript format, likely available through this repository. Special thanks to @markmillr on Github for his help developing the game.
